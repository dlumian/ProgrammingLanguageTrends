# ProgrammingLanguageTrends

Exploratory analysis using [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/programming-languages-trend-over-time/code) on programming languages.

Primary forecasting model is [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html).

## Forecast

For Python, Java, and C++ training data of counts of internet searches were used to predict future trends with Prophet. Counts were collected weekly from 2019-04-21 to 2024-04-21. Forecasts are projected weekly for the following year (52 predictions).

For each graph, a vertical dashed line indicates the end of existing data and the transition to predictions. 

NOTE: The bottom bar is a slider which can be used in interactive plots to zoom in on a subsection of the data.
